      "question": "You must isolate PCI workloads while sharing baseline services (logging, directory, DNS) with non-PCI apps. Which design is strongest?",
      "options": [
        "Single VPC with security groups",
        "Dedicated accounts for PCI and shared services with AWS Organizations SCPs",
        "Two subnets in one VPC with NACLs",
        "VPC peering between PCI and non-PCI subnets"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Separate accounts enforce blast radius and clearer guardrails; SCPs plus shared services (logging, DNS) accounts keep boundaries explicit."
    },
    {
      "id": "sec-002",
      "question": "A data lake needs encryption at rest, key rotation, and least privilege for analytics jobs. Which KMS strategy aligns best?",
      "options": [
        "Use the AWS managed S3 key (SSE-S3)",
        "One customer managed CMK per account with automatic rotation, scoped IAM policies",
        "A single CMK shared across prod and non-prod buckets",
        "Client-side encryption only"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Customer managed CMKs with rotation and scoped IAM provide granular access control and auditable key use for regulated workloads."

    {
      "id": "sec-003",
      "question": "You need workload identities to access AWS APIs without long-lived keys from an external OIDC provider. Best option?",
      "options": [
        "Store access keys in Secrets Manager",
        "IAM roles with OIDC identity provider and role assumption",
        "Create IAM users with MFA only",
        "Use instance profiles exclusively"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Setting an IAM OIDC identity provider and assuming roles removes static keys and uses short-lived credentials tied to external identities."
